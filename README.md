# Fortran -> JS Docker image

This project provides a [https://www.docker.com/](Docker) image that contains
a working FORTRAN -> Javascript compiler.

## TODO

1. Actually deliver on claim #1 above

## Work in Progress

There is a [https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/smikes/femscripten/](docker image) that includes llvm, gfortran, dragonegg, and emscripten.

I am trying to figure out how to do automate testing and how to automate
compilation of simple hello-world examples.
